# 📸 Fetch-a-gram

A collaborative mini web app inspired by Instagram — built by our team as part of a group project.  
It fetches images from a public API, displays them as a responsive gallery, and allows users to **like photos**, **add comments**, and **switch themes**.

## ⚙️ Deployment

The project uses **GitHub Actions** for continuous deployment:

- Every **push** or **pull request** to the `develop` branch triggers an automatic build and deploy.  
- The app is hosted via **GitHub Pages** — built directly from the `develop` branch.

### Part Anna 

I worked on the **Comments feature** and **deployment setup**.

Here is what I did:
- Implemented the comments functionality — users can view and add comments for each image in the popup.
- Ensured that the comment count is displayed correctly on both the popup and the feed thumbnails.
- Fixed the like and comment counters to always show the latest data after user interaction.
- Structured the code.
- Configured and tested the deployment setup, ensuring the app builds and runs correctly in the production environment (GitHub Pages / Vite).
- Worked with HTML and CSS where needed to adjust layout, improve responsiveness, and maintain visual consistency across the app.


### Part Jalal 

I worked on **Popup image viewer** and its **UI integration**

 - I implemented the image popup modal that opens when a user clicks on a photo. 
 - The popup displays the selected image in a larger view and includes next/previous navigation to move between images. 
 - I also created the UI section on the right side of the popup for comments and likes, which team mates later expanded with functionality to post and store user interactions.


### Part Saheena

I worked on the **Footer section**.  
Here is what I did:

- Added a **Project Repo link** with the GitHub logo for easy access to the repository.
- Added team member **LinkedIn profiles** with logos for attribution.
- Made the footer **responsive** so it adapts to both small and large screens.
- Designed a clean and simple layout that aligns with the overall app theme.
- Used simple **HTML and CSS** so the team can easily maintain it.

I worked on the **Like functionality**.
Here is what I did:

- Users can **like an image from the popup**.
- Updates **like count in the popup instantly**.
- Syncs the **like count with feed cards** on the main page.
- Tracks **changed likes** to refresh feed images when the popup is closed.
- Modular and reusable functions (**likeImage**
 **refreshSingleImage**,**updateLikeCountInFeed**) for easy maintenance.

 **likeImage**: Sends a POST request to the API to like an image, updates the heart icon and like count in the popup.

 **refreshSingleImage**: Fetches the latest like count for a single image and updates the feed.

 **updateLikeCountInFeed**: Updates the like count on the feed cards and updates local data.


### 🌸 Part Yordanos



🌸 Part Yordanos

- I worked on both the Header section and the Feed system — including connecting to the API, displaying photos, and improving the overall responsive design.

- 🧭 Header

- Created a sticky header that stays at the top while scrolling.

- Implemented a Dark / Light / Auto theme toggle that automatically follows the user’s system theme (so it changes color based on the user’s device settings).

🖼️ Feed (API + Display)

- Connected the app to the Image Feed API to fetch photos dynamically.
   Cleaned and normalized the API data so each photo card always has:

- an id,

- an image source (src),

- a likes_count,

- and a list of comments.

- Rendered the fetched photos into the feed as image cards.
  Added a “Load More” button to fetch and display new photos from the next API pages.

- Ensured smooth responsive behavior across all devices.
