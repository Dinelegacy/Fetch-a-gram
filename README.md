# Fetch-a-gram

This is a small web app made by our team.  
It shows photos like Instagram and allows dark/light mode.

## ðŸŒ¸ My Part (Yordanos)

I worked on the **Header section**.  
Here is what I did:

- Added a **sticky header** that stays on top when you scroll.
- Added a **logo** and the **Fetch-a-gram** name.
- Added a **Dark Mode / Light Mode toggle** that changes the color of the whole page.
- Made the header **responsive** (works on small and big screens).
- Wrote **simple CSS and JavaScript** so everyone on the team can understand it.

## ðŸ§  How the Dark Mode Works

- The toggle button adds or removes a class called `dark-mode` on the `<body>`.
- When `dark-mode` is active, the background turns dark navy and the text turns white.
- When you click again, it goes back to light mode.
