📸 Project Brief: Image Feed App
📝 Overview

In this group project (4 members), you will create a web application that displays a collection of images fetched from an external API. The goal is to apply your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to build an interactive, data-driven interface.

You are free to design the UI — get inspired by platforms like Instagram or Unsplash.

🚀 Getting Started

You will receive starter code with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

To begin:

Fork or clone the repository

Build the app using the provided structure

Only vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks or external libraries

🔗 API Documentation:
https://image-feed-api.vercel.app/

Feature	Difficulty
Display likes & comments	Easier
Loading states + error handling	Medium
Pagination / Load More	Medium
Submit new comments	Challenging
